# Multi-Role Dashboard Announcement Filtering Fix

## Issue
When a user has multiple roles (e.g., Dean + HOD), announcements targeted to specific roles (like "HOD only") were showing up on all their dashboards instead of only the relevant dashboard.

## Root Cause
The announcement filtering logic was checking if the user had ANY of the target roles, rather than filtering based on the currently active dashboard role.

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes (`announcementController.js`)

1. **Added `activeRole` Query Parameter Support**
   - Modified `getAnnouncements` function to accept `activeRole` query parameter
   - When `activeRole` is provided, filter announcements specifically for that role
   - Added validation to ensure user actually has the claimed `activeRole`

2. **Updated Role-Based Filtering Logic**
   ```javascript
   // Before: Showed announcements for ALL user roles
   { 'targetAudience.targetRoles': { $in: userRoles } }
   
   // After: Shows announcements only for the active dashboard role
   const filterRole = activeRole || userRole;
   { 'targetAudience.targetRoles': filterRole }
   ```

3. **Admin Role Handling**
   - Admins only see all announcements when no `activeRole` is specified
   - When admin accesses a specific role dashboard, they see filtered results for that role

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated Dashboard Routes**
   - `DeanDashboard.js`: Pass `currentRole="dean"` to `AnnouncementManagementPage`

2. **Updated AnnouncementManagementPage**
   - Accept `currentRole` prop
   - Pass `currentRole` to `HierarchicalAnnouncementBoard`
   - Removed obsolete `superadmin` role references

3. **Updated HierarchicalAnnouncementBoard**
   - Accept `currentRole` prop
   - Add `activeRole` parameter to API calls when `currentRole` is provided
   - Re-load announcements when `currentRole` changes

## API Changes

### GET /api/announcements
**New Query Parameter:**
- `activeRole` (optional): Filter announcements for specific role context

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
// Show only dean-targeted announcements
GET /api/announcements?activeRole=dean

// Show only hod-targeted announcements  
GET /api/announcements?activeRole=hod
```

## Behavior After Fix

### Multi-Role User (Dean + HOD)
- **Dean Dashboard**: Only shows announcements targeted to "dean" role
- **HOD Dashboard**: Only shows announcements targeted to "hod" role
- **Admin Dashboard**: Shows all announcements (if user is also admin)

### Single-Role User
- No change in behavior - works as before

### Security
- Users can only request `activeRole` for roles they actually possess
- Backend validates role ownership before filtering

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Create HOD-only announcement as admin**
   - ✅ Should appear on HOD dashboard
   - ❌ Should NOT appear on Dean dashboard (for multi-role users)

2. **Create Dean-only announcement**
   - ✅ Should appear on Dean dashboard  
   - ❌ Should NOT appear on HOD dashboard (for multi-role users)

3. **Create All Users announcement**
   - ✅ Should appear on all dashboards

## Status: IMPLEMENTED ✅

The fix ensures that role-specific announcements only appear on the relevant dashboard, providing proper role context separation for multi-role users.
