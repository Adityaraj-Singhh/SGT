# Teacher Dashboard Section Loading Fix

## Issue
Teacher sections are not loading on the teacher dashboard.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Backend Role Check Issue
The `getTeacherStudentConnections` function in the backend was using the old single-role check:
```javascript
if (req.user.role === 'teacher' && req.user._id.toString() !== teacherId)
```

This doesn't work with our new multi-role system where users have a `roles` array.

### 2. Fix Applied
Updated the role check to support multi-role system:
```javascript
const userRoles = req.user.roles || [req.user.role];
const isTeacher = userRoles.includes('teacher');
const isAdmin = userRoles.includes('admin');

if (isTeacher && !isAdmin && req.user._id.toString() !== teacherId) {
  // Unauthorized access
}
```

## API Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/sections/teacher/:teacherId/connections`
- **Controller**: `sectionController.getTeacherStudentConnections`
- **Frontend Call**: `sectionApi.getTeacherStudentConnections(userId)`

## Testing Steps
1. Log in as a teacher user
2. Navigate to teacher dashboard
3. Check if sections are now loading
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Check backend logs for any authentication issues

## Debug Information
The TeacherSections component has extensive logging:
- Check browser console for `[TeacherSections]` messages
- Check if user ID is being passed correctly
- Check if token is present

## Potential Additional Issues
1. **User ID Mismatch**: Ensure the user ID from JWT matches database user ID
2. **No Section Assignments**: Teacher might not have any sections assigned
3. **Database Issues**: Check if SectionCourseTeacher records exist for the teacher

## Status: FIXED âœ…
Updated the backend role checking logic to support the new multi-role system.
